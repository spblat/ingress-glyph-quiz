ingress-glyph-quiz
==================

![](http://i.imgur.com/rxYNEGk.png)

This little hack provides an interactive quiz to help you learn the "hacking 
glyphs" in the game Ingress. Thanks to http://glyphtionary.com for the images 
you see in this quiz.

It's crude and probably buggy. It was made by [@spblat](http://twitter.com/spblat). It's licensed under 
the MIT License, which means I don't really care what happens to it but I 
do retain some basic rights.

This script displays images pulled directly from glyphtionary.com. If this 
annoys them they have the ability to break this script by denying access 
except with a proper referrer. If they do that, I'll give them this code 
and ask them to host it themselves, cause that would be cool.

To do maybe (perhaps by someone else):

- Make it so that you can't cheat by looking at the status bar
- Keep score
- Track a user's trouble glyphs and focus on those
- CSS/make it pretty/close HTML tags etc
- Eliminate dependence on glyphtionary.com images

Features I don't care about:

- Make it so you can't cheat by hacking the URL
- Social networking features, score-sharing
- Make it use cookies for some reason
- Cookies
