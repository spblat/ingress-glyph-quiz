You'll need to know how to get a perl script to run on a web server.
Look into things like "mod_perl" and "apache perl cgi". Sorry, I
won't help you do this.

Because you probably shouldn't keep a perl script and a css file
in the same directory, most default apache configurations won't
"just work" if you use git to clone this software into /cgi-bin.
Consider trying something like this (Centos 6.5 taken as an example):

cd /var/www/html
git clone git://github.com/spblat/ingress-glyph-quiz.git
cd /var/www/cgi-bin
ln -s /var/www/html/ingress-glyph-quiz/glyphquiz.pl glyphquiz.pl

...then visit http://yourserver/cgi-bin/glyphquiz.pl.

If it doesn't work, check the error log. Perhaps you need to add
"FollowSymLinks" to httpd.conf in <Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin">
under Options.
